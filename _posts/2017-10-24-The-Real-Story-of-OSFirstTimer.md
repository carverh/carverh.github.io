title: The Real Story of OSFirstTimer
---
[OSFirstTimer](https://www.youtube.com/user/OsFirstTimer) is a YouTube channel started in 2012 where Philip Adams, the creator of the channel, has his mother try out operating systems. If you think that nothing bad can come of that you would be wrong, very wrong.

I started watching OSFirstTimer in 2013. I did not join the OSFirstTimer fourms, [techTalk/OSTalk](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/osfirsttimer/) so most of this info is based on second hand accounts, pastebins and logs. Most of the forum posts from before 2016 have been deleted and Rayton, the site that hosted the archive, has shutdown forever.

## ShiftOS
ShiftOS _was_ a "game" created by Philip Adams. I put game in quotation marks because its more of a operating system simulator than a game. Philip developed the game until 2014, when he handed over development to a group of developers who would develop the game. This was a very, very bad idea. It caused the quality of updates to decrease.
